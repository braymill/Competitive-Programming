# Competitive Programming
Repository of competitive programming problems I've worked on and/or solved. Goal for these competitions is to solve advanced programming questions as quickly as possible; as such, variable names are often short abbreviations and code structure may be slightly unorganized with several different attempts at a given problem included.
